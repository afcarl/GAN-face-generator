# Generating faces using GANs

This project was done as part of Udacity's DLFND. 

## Description

In this project, it should be possible to generate faces using the CelebA dataset.

## Architecture

The architecture was chosen as described in the initial DCGAN research paper "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks‚Äù.
